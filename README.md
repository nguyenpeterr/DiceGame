# DiceGame

A 2-Player game of dice where the first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

Player 1 rolls the dice and the current score is added on the bottom. The player can decide to keep rolling to add to the score, or hold the points and end their turn.
Player 2 begins their turn, and the game continues back and forth.

If the player rolls a "1", their current score is reset and their turn ends.
